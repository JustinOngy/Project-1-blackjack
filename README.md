# Challenges
During my time working on this project, I experienced difficulty with an abundance of code and a messy environment as I would just write code without keeping organized. This confused me and did slow me down as I thought some functions were doing something  but they actually were even the right code. This made it very hard to find the code I was looking for so to fix this I organized my javascript code into categories, after spending the time to organize them, made me work a lot more efficiently and quicker.

More specific problems that I faced whilst programming this project was understanding the game logic behind blackjack and its rules. It's complex with the ace card holding two values depending on the cards in the hand, Despite being quite easy for humans to understand, this was a difficult concept to code. The solution to this was to keep the ace value as 11 and also keep track of the number of aces using a count. By using a for of loop, we are able to check the current card and iterate through the hand adding the values together. Then check the ace count, if the number of aces is greater than 0 and more than 2 aces subtract 10 from the value.
