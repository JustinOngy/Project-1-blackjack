# Challenges
During my time working in this project I experienced difficulty with an abundance of code and a messy environement as I would just write code without keeping organised. This confused me and did slow me down to as I thought some functions were doing something  but they actually were even the right code. This made it very hard to find the code I was looking for so to fix this i organised my javascript code into categories, after spending the time to organise them, made me work alot more efficiently and quicker.

More specific problems that i faced whilst programing this project was understanding the game logic behind blackjack and its rules. It's complexity with the ace card holding two values depending on the cards in the hand, despite being quite easy for humans to understand, this was a difficult concept to code. The solution to this was to keep the ace value as 11 and also keep track of the number of aces using a count. By using a for of loop, we are able to check the current card and iterate through the hand adding the values together. Then checks the ace count, if the number of aces are greater than 0 and more than 2 aces subtract 10 from the value.
